## About Globe Gate
The average cross border fee in the USA is 4.6%, and only 13% of citizens mostly transfer using cryptocurrency. By using cryptocurrency, we know we can significantly reduce this number, yet the main reason it's not more utilised is the high barriers to entry, making it inaccessible to non-technical people. 

This is why we built a Globe Gates - an application with a Web2 feel, but powered by Web3 and Stablecoins, ensuring a fair market decided price, low fees and instant transactions. In one app, you can transfer money to your friends and family across the world, and they will receive their native currency.


We deployed our own decentralised exchange, as well as our own 2 mock stable coin tokens in Solidity onto the EVM sidechain. We adapted the typical token exchange - by creating a contract that both transfers and converts in a single transaction. We leveraged XRP's cross border payments capabilities along with EVM's stablecoins, to create a tailored application bespoke to the XRP ecosystem.
